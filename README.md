## About Android Pokedex project
Hello there,
In this project I tried showcasing how to build an Android Application in Jetpack Compose with clean architecture and MVI using some of the jetpack libraries with Kotlin Coroutines & Dagger Hilt. This App is using the [PokeApi](https://github.com/favware/graphql-pokemon) as a remote data source.

This app is based on the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) article, [Kotlin 1.5](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew13.html), and [coroutine](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html). I also used some android architecture components like [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/livedata), [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).

You can check my short term backlog in my Github Projects [here](https://github.com/felipecastilhos/pokedex-android/projects/1)
